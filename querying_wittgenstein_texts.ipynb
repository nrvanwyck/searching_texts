Well, these laws fit entirely into the use of language that he is so familiar with. Then he learns perhaps to prove more complicated propositions of logic. The proofs are exhibited to him, and he is again convinced; or he invents proofs himself. In this way he learns new techniques of inference. And also, what account to lay it to, if now errors appear.
